# Vniverse

Vniverse is a poetry instrument you can play. Draw constellations of stars and words, follow tercets aligned with the stars, and consult the mysterious Oracle.

This app accompanies and complements a print book by Stephanie Strickland, V: WaveTercets / Losing L'una, published by SpringGun Press in 2014. It was developed by Ian Hatcher, in collaboration with Stephanie Strickland.

For more information, and to view the Shockwave version of Vniverse created by Strickland and Cynthia Lawson Jaramillo in 2002, please visit vniverse.com.
