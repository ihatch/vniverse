If you understand virginity,
you understand abstraction, you understand V--
V which is flight, and you understand VVV,

2
i.e., ric-rac, the earliest recorded
symbolic motif, Cassiopeian breasts pouring forth
a Milky Way, a.k.a. zigzag,

3
world-over water, meander, serpentine
cupmark U adjoining its inverse, upsidedown
U (please imagine), yourself

4
optimizing, as you do not lift but leave
your point (become pointed) pressed hard
to bone to pull that bone

5
writhing on your point, twist it one way,
then the other--a rhythm method making
your water mark.

6
If you understand red, you understand ruby,
you understand light bubbling up struck seam
first morning cliff; you do not

7
mock the real
as you watch it subside and divide and then run
like morning into the virtual.

8
If you understand vulva, you understand lens,
you understand an entrance
to unsuspected, fertile, labyrinthine darkness,

9
the power of ex-opponents or logs. If you put
your meander/zigzag/ric-rac
on your fabricated lens-shape, if indeed you dip

10
your lens into water and discover that the water
you meant to mark the lens with as a sign
of vulval moisture

11
is itself a lens, this clear drop beading up
on your lens stone, and you can see through it
to a life in the stone, to a depth

12
you did not suspect, do you bother to go back
to your old ox-head, its uterine face,
its Fallopian horns, to mark them

13
with meander, once you have discovered
wells open at the bottom leading to the next world,
wormholes, keyholes, the high

14
road to heaven, the flying carpet, the cataract?
You might. You might
go back,

15
stunned--for you no longer live
but rather remember what is a suddenly long-ago
childhood: marks

16
as marks, flesh as flesh,
their secrets those of separate realms.
Back then, a diagrammed

17
circuit <i>not</i> a circuit, as it is, now,
incised by the woman's, or the robotic,
“hand” on the golden wafer

18
in the virginally pure and guarded
clean room, eye to lens, as she makes her
--but whose?--meander mark.

19
If you understand virginity,
you understand abstraction and all there is to know
of immaculate, conception.

20
If you understood red, but--you cannot;
for you understand web
glistening in sunlight as stronger than steel

21
per ounce. You attempt to reverse engineer it,
as you once calibrated the magnification achieved
by a dewdrop, compelled,

22
and even soothed;
but if you understood ruby, the haunted road
of a human

23
voice, complex waveform,
not (by the ear) disassembled, not
processed in separate

24
recordings, followed on
by component reunitings, no <i>visual</i> mix, but all fused
into one

25
vibration received by one membrane,
the eardrum...porous...heard herald world
of word shaped.

26
When Columba converted the mermaid,
which of them said,
“Is it really

27
you?”
And then, after a time, who
replied, “How good is God's memory?”

28
Struggling to ward off being mounted,
since this would leave the chorus
without a conductor, and sensing a near-

29
lag in the beat, the man with too much state
in his head holds tempo,
pacing, tone, and volume constant,

30
but instructs the drummer (who is rarely, really
never, mounted) to vary
the breaks, to force possession

31
or reprieve it, techniques
to project
from psyche to physique

32
to psyche. A waltz
frames the mind of coquetry;
a tango, desolation.

33
That drummer in control during ritual
--but not of it;
that drummer in control during ceremony,

34
barely of it, has changed his name.
He plays Intendo on the virtual
causeway to the titular

35
see: he is a mystery fan.
<i>Is it really you</i>,
he longs to say, but I swim away,

36
repeating his beat, his cadence,
with my tail,
so opening a channel.

37
A channel only open, not a code, no
message, for him
to break. I fall away

38
from his design and say
to myself, so, we must meet apart
in a time

39
of no tomorrow, no pleading, no art,
time of waiting, a miracle mer-main
of hallucinated hearing.

40
Fin(-ger) to finger, I shiver,
am calm: the reef embraces the water
that wears it

41
down.
You have seen, with your own eyes, yes?
Or believed the lie that it can't

42
be lost, that it lives
somewhere else, somewhere safe
as it is not

43
in that slippery, silken twist
of cord
run by rhythm through psyche

44
to physique to sea to sky to water falling, dripping
with the sound of the water bird veering
on whose back

45
the earth rides.
Apprehended where every cell engaged: an entire body,
paralyzed, knees

46
drawn up, nails drawing blood,
neck rigid, tears streaming from shut
eyes, locked jaw, grinding teeth:

47
that silent song
possesses every
Erzulie, Her every <i>serviteur</i>, whose fragile

48
beauty, whose zephyr lilting lightness
has been tempered
by the cracking whip, by Petro fire,

49
Erzulie Ge-Rouge, who comes to the poor
in pink and white perfection, cologne
lavished from a faceted bottle and a swath of lace

50
down the skirt of her improvised dressing table,
she is almost Tennessee's
Blanche, whispering coquette, all

51
roses, shells, and smile,
until she starts to weep.
And cannot

52
be stopped, every cell engaged.
Is Tuesday her day? Rose her scent?
Titon

53
will tell you, you must feast her.
You must replenish
Source, would you keep her,

54
going back and forth, not as a footpath,
but a smile.
Not as a footpath, as a meal.

55
We do not eat to turn into food--food which we think
we can reach out and take,
but we cannot take what can only be given.

56
He now let the animals name <i>him</i>.
He played tag with them
and was vanquished by touch.

57
As she wove her seven-bristled,
quarter-circle broom,
as she told the days to parturition, did she curse

58
the most time-taking
way, the straight
path, the unaccelerated route?

59
Playing cat's
cradle with the V, wedging the gap,
corking

60
the grail, that bottle of time too soon
spilled out. Left to itself,
in tidal flows,

61
there would be no tomorrow.
She craves that drift.
But this is her

62
primordial
task, to keep time, to serve it, an order
learned from the water bird

63
who makes a 3-prong
Y print
in the sand, echoed each time she stands

64
in trembling waves.
A cast
shadow, a thrown reflection,

65
and a subtly bent refraction
where the water meets the sky
and the land, 3 axes, and a mapping,

66
and 5, she mapped, who veers
as she flies, who carries the tilted earth
on her back. This is hallucinated hearing

67
in the service of art, of Arthur's table,
R2, Artemis,
and Ursa guarding the Pole.

68
Welcome, then, Presence, Reflection, Shadow,
Refraction, She Who Stands,
Gnova, Gnomon, Goose, Ouzel, Orca, Longdark,

69
Hardware, Software, Wetware, a Dolphin
leaping, responding
to the bare boy on her back.

70
For a crown is a cradle.
Wings are conical baskets of grain, baskets of fish
slung from her shoulders.

71
She will apportion, determine, sustain
and guard,
Our She, if she keeps her cards going,

72
if she makes her pack,
if she burns the string figure holes in their backs,
peepholes to heaven, to check

73
on heaven and to check
heaven. If she serves
her mother, the Goose who is flying

74
into the gap, who uses
a hook, the hooked jaw of a salmon,
to tat, to get

75
from one side
to the other, a bird's only task
beyond keeping track,

76
a hook which appears
in the fourth year, the year
of its spawning,

77
the Year of its Leaping, dying, not eating, falling
apart as it travels up, flails
to breed.

78
Feel her power in bird or stone, or in her eyes
or breasts, alone, or even in
her hieroglyphs.

79
There is a woman with a conical hat.
When we chain her waist
with dice and cards,

80
a punished witch. The Jack of Knaves
comes up at 128, the one
who stole

81
her tart. She will sit
on a bird
or a broom. Or an axle-tree.

82
Or a mill wheel grinding.
She keeps time
timely, and you know her: Green, Great Circle, Noon.

83
My computer tells me
2:32
PM and so salutes her. Not P,

84
of course. Of courses, M
the <i>Maîtresse</i> (VV
reversed, please imagine), M the standard without which--

85
M not mother, but an anchorage, Anchoress, arbitrary
necessary prime first,
Royally

86
observed,
at the Green-wi( )ch
meridian.

87
A bee lives 28 days, that vaginal cadence,
nose swollen in honey.
The tree rings itself with another ring each year

88
and in its hollow live the bears--a world
tree closes. Major
and Minor, they circle the hole,

89
dipping honey from the hollow
at the tilted top
of the northern world, Polaris, star at the very end

90
of the Little Bear's tale.
To know
there is a pole, a polar axis to the earth,

91
and that it tilts. The thought
of such knowledge, hard to gain,
how to keep, we have lost,

92
except for the Rabbis who copy the Talmud,
who know by G[ ]d no scintilla
must change, not by unconscious slips,

93
not “corrected” by sages, not in 26,000 years--
me, I take what I get
from the Navy's lunar Web Page,

94
but I should go to Tarot: 52 weeks, 4 season
suites of 13 (moon-months, 14 x 2 days) [364] are not
enough: “a year and a day,” [365] will (nearly)

95
fit the sun in, that's the Joker,
and in the Leap, fourth
Year, a year-and-a-day and <i>another</i>

96
day, then the long counts begin. After one-hundred
and twenty-eight
years, the need to take a day <i>out</i>--

97
as the osprey pulls a salmon from the sea
or the knave steals a tart. Penelope, star
undoer, keeps 128 suitors

98
at bay, while her husband cycles.
At Arthur's table, 128 Knights.
26,000 years

99
for the pole to “precess,” to draw its circle
in the sky and return to the star
where it started out, while the Zodiac belt

100
slips backward through its signs.
2000 years ago we came
to the Age of Fishes, rising horizon at the vernal

101
equinox. But now arriving
at the Water Carrier, dare I mention
13 x 2000? Or the Tarot cards

102
in my Marseilles Deck,
my pocket calendar-calculator pack
that tracks the Platonic (the Precessional)

103
Great Year--a run-time,
portable version;
or my Wheel of (inevitable)

104
Fortune--that wedge, gap, joking Fool
at the top,
unnumbered, of no worth, holding all

105
together. So easy to forget,
to forget and conceive, to forget to turn
the card over, did I send a card

106
for Easter?
Original holes burned through to see
stars--who <i>are</i> those figures

107
(from an Ice Age? Neolithic?)
and what is the meaning
of the red bar?

108
(Do it over, upsidedown.) Rotate
and turn. 78
in all, my set compact.

109
All gods kill each other and all collapse,
except the horned. When, at last,
the King of Swords comes up, the Zodiac moves

110
one to the right, a complete Precession.
Insert Precession Day
and it moves back over, Crab again

111
in the middle, Crabs stabilizing Crosses
on the Grand Ellipse.
Little diamond-shaped double gaps

112
printed by a reindeer hoof.
And Lady with a heart-shaped face,
from 33,000

113
B.C.E., who knew the hidden
gate, that there is one, unknown
Joke as a tholepin of Creation,

114
gap. There is a Lady
with a conical hat. When we chain
her waist, when she hangs in a cage,

115
spread out, pinned up, in the market
place,
who

116
sees? Who but I,
sings
the bird: Sweeney in a tree, or Philomel,

117
or shepherds on the mountaintop.
Did Plato see?
Longing to say, <i>Is it really you?</i> All too

118
aware that the writing on his page
really wasn't, he heatedly forbade sung poems
of knowing in his <i>Republic</i>, even as he told

119
the old, the Orphic, the Egyptian, the lost
land undersea stories. The coast,
of course, had fallen

120
since the Ice Melt, the old shore now many miles
out. Though some escaped
to the offshore islands, or the Konya plain, and began

121
to imitate. Making a fake
from grotto to crypt, to the pre-final form
of stalactite and stalagmite, the Gothic cathedral,

122
to our Virtual CaVE™
Environment, in Illinois, where again we stage the Cosmic
Voyage to the Beginning--whose algorithm

123
this time?
Polished greenstone
double axes, a dying God

124
who had once returned intact:
in the beginning,
to stay alive and to leap from his back

125
between his horns. Then, not the bull
God, but the hunter returned.
Then not the hunter, but the hunter in pieces,

126
butchered, gored. Collected
by crazed women, crazed by the new thought,
the new

127
incompetence: to bring back a bull,
or ox, kill it, be killed
by it. Then in 14 pieces,

128
then 28, a moon-death,
for it was always, early
and always, about birth

129
and re-
birth. The child who went to the bull,
or to the dolphin, the girl

130
who became the hunter
was lured
from her task, or was it a boy, by the Titans,

131
the Giants, who offered toys: a top,
a mirror,
jointed dolls, knucklebone dice.

132
In the grave at Çatal Hüyük,
a bright blue neck,
green eyebrows on a skull--

133
are they wings of a bird?
Or a dragonfly in flight? Miniature
green stone axes

134
beside.
Metamorphosis
now morphosis, now

135
morphing: Matisse
repeating
that sea scene on a wall, in that same land

136
of reticulated caves,
a band of cells,
radiolaria-like, chromosome-like, germ-shapes seeding

137
the lens-fishes swimming in long meanders of sinusoidal
sun path,
centriole spindles tugging at the lens-ends, freefloating

138
4- and 5-fingered petal hands
trolling below, undergirding
the sea-band. Double axes

139
stabilize the quadrants
on the Grand Ellipse, the solar orbit: Solstice, Solstice;
Equinox, Equinox.

140
“We must seek,” Simone said, “at greater depth
our own source,
for the Church destroyed Oc,”

141
the Occitanian world, a resisting tide, a river
of peoples in the honey-
combed caves near Toulouse, near Marseilles.

142
As electrons rush the tube
at one-fifth the speed of light, do they testify
to a prehistoric rupture,

143
a Glacial flood, or the dangerously close-coming
passage of the moon as Roadrunner boulders, meteorites
careen through the sky, crater the earth,

144
or was an inner sense of hearing-counting lost,
when the children stopped coming together
in a brood, in the easy spring, conceived at Midsummer,

145
and began to be born <i>throughout</i> the year, whenever.
And began to be garnered as workers
in a settling world. Their,

146
now unpredictable, mothers
no longer wander.
Someone has seen--

147
Who but I, says the bird.
And it flies away.
Renewal

148
assumed
to the ranking ladder and ranked below power,
ownership, fixed place, Force, to enforce.

149
“Pure gold, not alchemist's gold...but the true metal
dug out from mines where dragons stand watch.”
Viète Isagoge, 1591. “He is referring,”

150
says André Weil, Simone's
brother, “to the power and scope of the new algebra.
The ore is from Diophantus.”

151
Screech owl nailed to the barnhouse door,
blows raining down on her,
fagots heaped. The persecutor's desire

152
to see,
as he sets the ordeal. What has happened? All
participate: sabbat.

153
Freud to Fleiss, 1897, is speaking about
<i>The Witch Fixer</i>, <i>Hexenhammer</i>,
in Latin, <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>, the work of two monks,

154
themselves German. “The medieval theory
of possession,” Freud writes, “upheld by ecclesiastical
tribunals is identical to our theory...

155
why do confessions extorted by torture bear so
much resemblance to my
patients' narratives during treatment?” A plaintive

156
tone, as in
“Procne is among the slaves,” that embroidered text
of a woman raped and her tongue cut out

157
by her brother-in-law. She is trying to address
her sister. And does. And they serve him
his child for dinner. And turn into birds.

158
Blank birds, they blend--into one name, Philomel.
Medieval story of the nightingale,
pressing her breast onto thorns, who can't remember

159
why she mourns. A real witch doesn't cry,
a real witch can't float.
Weight her down, if she drowns, you were correct

160
in your suspicions. Someone,
somewhere, saw, once, for the first time,
a rape, but which of them knew it?

161
“When the woman stays silent, it is
a grave sign,
also absence of tears.” <i>MM (HH, The Witch Fixer)</i>.

162
Water for the body,
language for the heart, found with the woman
of another tribe drawing at the well, with the water bird.

163
The woman who fails to inhibit her speech,
who can't stop talking, who can't stop bleeding,
an issue of blood, who can't stop flowing,

164
who can't stop putting her hair to his feet,
drying his feet with her flowing hair,
who can't stop spending. Widow who seeks

165
the smallest mite, but not to save it, to save the Year,
to retrieve and give it, giving all.
Wise virgins, who know to expect and provide.

166
How <i>could</i> desire
outrun satisfaction? Who is constantly
solicited, never satisfied, driven, forced to it,

167
forced to instruct: an albatross
at his neck,
provocative bird, for aimless years

168
above his conquering ship, on motionless wings,
before it lit--or would have lit--on Ramirez Island
where it had taken off. An albatross

169
mates for life
and returns to nest. But when it lifts, it glides five years
on its motionless--now bloodied, flapping wings.

170
How to make nothing of something.
Don't take me amiss. I mean nothing
by it, I mean only lightness,

171
a zephyr, a lilt, evanescent
yielding,
I mean electronic.

172
The ore is from Diophantus.
“The idea is to form the algebra of sections
of the bundle over the leaf space.

173
[Gap] ...closed currents
on the space of leaves...a new technique--...to...reach
below the Planck scale and attempt to decipher

174
the fine structure
of space-time.” <i>Notices of the AMS</i>, August
1997.

175
On “Kung Fu:
The Legend Continues,” I learn to fear
the carved green phallus

176
covered with a dark cloth. Quivering bolts
leap to its beak, hiss intermittently,
attract, leach; but I'm taught to respect

177
the carved green chalice
protected by transparence;
though I cannot imagine

178
how to lift it, as Caine can, I drift inside it,
the low, flat, deep, full-footed bowl of figured mineral,
bone, horn, filigreed, veined with dark.

179
A complex message can pass only between
--emanation and absorption--
complexities of structure. In crystals

180
and organisms, resonant feedback
is required. Encounters of a special, precarious
sort. To claim a sense of company that survives

181
the loss of friends. To be vetted by
an Archaic
smile, by the kindness of strangers, a hazel nut,

182
the Duke o' Norroway, or a water bird.
A knowledge unsupported
by community, language, gender: a deep

183
exclusion, taking refuge, remembering
ordeal. His need to see. Remembering
burning. And communion in a garret.

184
A vision which ends, “I must withdraw,”
some sentences after
being thrown out.

185
Terror trapped in muscle cells.
Locked jaw, gritted teeth. A seeker
of perfection: once ravished, twice chaste.

186
Some see the strong <i>fiat</i> as hopelessly strong
and steel their mind to it.
Some see nothing, happenstance, confusion.

187
At the quantum, basis of all that is stable,
numeric and morphic play with each other.
Not whether, but when: each level within

188
the atom, a pattern of resonant lock--
and each one without.
Hard steel punch. Soft silver being chased.

189
Everything you taste, or hear, or touch,
has a kind of limit, in response to stress,
beyond which relaxation is...to...something

190
other.
Loss of core memory.
Erasure.

191
“Without this there would be no histor[y, no]
individuality in complex structures,”
says Smith, in <i>The Search for Structure</i>, MIT Press.

192
Is Heaven, then,
the never failing pattern, the refrain
that cannot stop?

193
If for history to come,
it must destruct,
how

194
good could Memory be?
That swell of breakage, torn tissue
of threads,

195
tangle adrift, ends
to pull. Is it taken on to make us?
By whom?

196
By what?
Vacuum fluctuation? Water Witch Wings?
A blushing whole?

197
Some would say shame
at such Fullness, a.k.a.
Emptiness, would motivate an act of defloration.

198
Some would say,
love leads to de-creation, Simone's word, the putting away
of power, laying it aside, in a free

199
act of bittersweet removal, as
the Duke
in <i>Measure for Measure</i>.

200
The singularities of an automorphic
function are, if not a circle, a Cantor dust,
defusing the ancient paradox,

201
divisible without end but not continuous.
The infinitely thin
curtains swept back and back of a Cantor dust

202
“that seem to correspond
to a very deep
reality.” Mathematicians

203
pen that stuff.
Minute portions of the world precisely as complex
and organized as the large.

204
Misfits may form
completely independent patterns
of their own, as beats in music,

205
or moiré in silk.
No equilibrium, when any <i>memory</i> of the previous
--vestige, remnant, trace, or ray--retained.

206
If we understood red, her web
blocking the path, glistening in sun, as the strong
door to dust, as a form

207
of strong transparence,
protecting the chalice, the bear, the canting horn,
filigreed, veined with dark.

208
Fear in the nursery.
Uninvited guest.
A spindle gift.

209
A child sleeps for a hundred years
behind the briar hedge.
One prick of blood.

210
What does matter about the function
is the nature of the peak
at its very center. Green and graceful witch,

211
inland woman who took the fury out
of the sea, (dis)solved in time, true, Mab has been
with thee, Mer Medb, Guinevere,

212
Finnabair, take off your shoes, spout
and prune, “do
while” the arc lasts in the sky--a double

213
positive is
not
a negative. “Yeah,

214
yeah.”
:) Deep
rule(s), par-t[ur]i-tion.

215
The delicacy
of fractal curves, point jumping
in the phase space,

216
tracery of frost on glass.
Any
section of such blown up--equally

217
exquisite, detailed, ever, over and over, a never
ending,
never decaying, never

218
exactly
the same pattern--recognizable at once.
Begin with a closed interval, include ends,

219
take out the middle: on the separated them, do
again, again...creating, or leaving, a structure more and more
open, of sparkling points.

220
Indra's Net? Cantor dust.
Do there exist beings where all take each other
into account, in their very core?

221
The smallest particles.
Renormalized photons.
List. I say <i>list</i>, that long implicit, blurred string

222
my mother
left me.
Isomorphism, another name for coding.

223
Words of others.
Lists and strings are fluid data structures.
The Glacier, calving, enormous roar

224
into a gray silent sea,
turquoise
lining.

225
Krill stains the snow
and the breasts of the penguins.
1/10th of a second,

226
the time it takes
to recognize your mother.
From one hundred million

227
retinal dots
to one
word

228
--<i>is it really</i>
<i>you</i>
<i>I long to say?</i>

229
Skim and teeter
of a moving balance, her beret,
Simone's,

230
as she stands
at prayer, very
slightly

231
swaying--swaying in the air
above her,
an emerald darner

232
hovers;
that, I think, she hears, but
does not see.
